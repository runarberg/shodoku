The primary goal is to provide\n      as much context as possible as you practice writing and reading each\n      kanji. Instead of just the meanings and the readings of each character, we\n      provide you with the whole dictionary to help you remember.\n    </p>\n\n    <section id=\"section:usage\">\n      <h3>How to use</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        Start by\n        <RouterLink :to=\"deckBrowserRoute\"> selecting a deck </RouterLink> to\n        study. This will put all the kanji in that deck in your review queue, in\n        the same order as they appear in the deck. You can have several decks.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        After you have selected a deck you can\n        <RouterLink :to=\"reviewRoute\"> start reviewing </RouterLink>. We start\n        by teaching you how to write the kanji. If you don’t know the stroke\n        order, you can click the hint button next to the drawing pad to see the\n        next stroke. When you are done the correct strokes will appear under\n        your drawing. Click the play button to compare your stoke orders.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        As you practice writing you can scroll down to see all the words and\n        example sentences that contains this kanji. The kanji it self will be\n        hidden but the readings will appear as furigana above it. This may help\n        you remembering the kanji.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        When you are ready you can click <em>Show Writing</em>. This will reveal\n        the kanji, the strokes, and the components it is comprised of. It is\n        recommended that you study these components and create stories that\n        relate to the meaning of the kanji which will help you remember it. When\n        you review this character this may make it easier for you to remember\n        how to draw it.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        When you are ready to move on to the next character select one of the\n        four options to rate its difficulty. This rating will affect how long of\n        a time will pass until you review this character. Repeat this process\n        until you have no characters left in your review queue.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The next day your review queue will fill up again. This time you may be\n        asked to review not just <em>writing</em>, but also <em>reading</em> the\n        character. In reading practice, try to remember the meaning of the\n        character. You can also scroll down to see the character used in real\n        words. The furigana for that character will be hidden, try to remember\n        how to read some of these words. Finally reveal the answer and rate the\n        difficulty same as you did with your writing practice previously.\n      </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section id=\"section:data-sources\">\n      <h3>Data Sources</h3>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          Kanji strokes and radical/component info are from\n          <a href=\"https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/\" target=\"_blank\">KanjiVG</a>.\n          This includes mappings between components and kanji, e.g. used in the\n          component picker.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Kanji meaning, readings, and frequency data comes from\n          <a\n            href=\"http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >KANJIDIC Project</a\n          >.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Vocabulary words, readings, and glosses come from\n          <a\n            href=\"http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/JMdict-EDICT_Dictionary_Project\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            >JMdict-EDICT Dictionary Project</a\n          >.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Example sentences and translations come from\n          <a href=\"https://tatoeba.org\" target=\"_blank\">Tatoeba</a>.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          JLPT data comes from\n          <a href=\"http://www.tanos.co.uk/jlpt/\" target=\"_blank\"\n            >JLPT Resources</a\n          >\n          by <span class=\"author\">Jonathan Waller</span>.
